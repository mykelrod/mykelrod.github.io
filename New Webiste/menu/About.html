        <h2>Objectives</h2><br><hr/>
        <p>We at <b>AC POWER Plant Maintenance Services</b> started initiating awareness to our employees on how to safeguard and protect themselves and the society from deadly wide spreading COVID- 19 virus.</p>
        <p>By giving awareness like the following:</p><br>

        <h4>1. How does COVID-19 spread?</h4>
        <p>Data has shown that it spreads from person to person among those in close contact. The virus spreads thru respiratory droplets.</p><br>
        <h4>2. What are the symptoms of COVID-19?</dt></h4>
        <p>Covid-19 symptoms can be very mild to severe and include a fever, cough and shortness of breath. Some people have no symptoms. Symptoms may appear two to 14 days after exposure. People may be sick with the virus for 1 to 14 days before developing symptoms. The most common symptoms of corona virus disease (COVID-19) are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. More rarely, the disease can be serious and even fatal.</p>
        <p>Older people, and people with other medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, or heart disease), may be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill.</p>
        <ul>People may experience:</ul>
        <li class="symptoms">Cough</li>
        <li class="symptoms">Fever</li>
        <li class="symptoms">Tiredness</li>
        <li class="symptoms">Difficulty breathing (severe cases)</li><br>

        <h4>3. Can COVID-19 be prevented or treated?</h4>
        <p>A vaccine isn’t currently available to the public for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).Treatment is directed at relieving symptoms. </p><br>

        <h4><ul>4. What can I do to avoid becoming ill?</h4>
          <li class="prevention">Avoid large events and mass gatherings.</li>
          <li class="prevention">Avoid close contact (within 6 feet, or 2 meters) with anyone who is sick has symptoms.</li>
          <li class="prevention">Keep distance between yourself and others if COVID-19 is spreading in your community, if you have a higher risk of serious illness.</li>
          <li class="prevention">Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.</li>
          <li class="prevention">Cover your mouth and nose with your elbow or a tissue when you cough sneeze. Throw away the used tissue at bin.</li>
          <li class="prevention">Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth</li>
          <li class="prevention">Clean and disinfect surface you often touch on a daily basis</li>
